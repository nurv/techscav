# Technology Scavenger
This application craws a set of domains looking for usages of a given list of web services. This application creates a bunch of threads and goes through the list of domains, doing a HTTP request to each one and trying to find domains in the HTML.

## Usage:
`
$ python techscav.py <file with list of domains>
`

Other options:

* ``-p``, ``--properties`` - the location of the property file
* ``-m``, ``--mode`` - what execution mode to use
* ``-j``, ``--phantomjs-bin`` - where the PhantomJS binary is located (only necessary if using the PhantomJS dectection mode)
* ``-t``, ``--threads`` - how many threads should the application spwan

Check ``--help`` for more information.

## Properties File
The properties file describes what web servies the system should be looking for. Each property can have more than one domain associated (e.g. Google â†’ ``google.com``, ``google.pt``, ``gmail.com``, etc.). Below is a sample:

```
{
  "properties":[
    {
      "name": "Foo",
      "domains": [
        "foo.com"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Bar",
      "domains": [
        "bar.com",
        "deleta.com"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Tests
To run tests just run nosetests:
```
$ nosetests
```

To check coverage, use the flag ``--with-coverage``:
```
$ nosetests --with-coverage
```
